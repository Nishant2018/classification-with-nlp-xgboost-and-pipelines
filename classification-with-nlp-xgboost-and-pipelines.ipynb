We go through all the preprocessing steps, show the elements of the classifier model and finally present its performance. Having 35 different grape type, the model manages to predict their variety with 60% accuracy. *\n\n## Introduction\nA while ago we started to work on a wine project that tried to imitate blind tasting of wines. We have built a classification model that, based on a wine description given by an expert or semi-expert, is able to tell what grape was used to produce that wine. Unfortunately it is not easy to find such descriptions, so we decided to collect data ourselves. We managed to tell the grape type of four different grapes with 85% accuracy.\n\nHere we will work with 35 different grapes (or collection of grapes) that has more than 200 samples in the data base. Relying on our data cleaning, preprocessing, text vectorization and an XGBoost classifier we manage to achieve 65% accuracy in telling what grape was used to produce the wine under inspection. \n\nWe will start by importing the data then we **drop the features we are not interested in, remove duplicates and NAs, remove accents from text and make everything lower case**. We will process the target feature (grape variety) too. **One grape type may appear under different names**. One reason for that is that in different country they have different names. We try to bring them under the same name. Furthermore, we **introduce colours of the wine as a new input feature**, since during blind tasting, the expert can actually look at the colour of the wine. \n\nFor the classification model we define **stop words, a class for lemma tokenization, a tf-idf vectorizer and an XGBoost classifier**. We use **pipelines** to put all these things together.  \n\nFinally we show the implementation of the model, present **hyperparameter tuning and cross validation testing**. At the end we will show a little discussion about the effect of having **inbalanced number of target features** and options to deal with it. \n\n## Table of contents\n1. [Importing data](#ch1)\n2.

The power of XGBoost lies in its scalability, which drives fast learning through parallel and distributed computing and offers efficient memory usage.  \n\nWe will not do a very detailed hyperparameter optimization becuase it is very time consuming, but rather predifine certain input arguments that control the performance of the classifier and use one argument to otpimize.  *subsample* controls the ratio of the randomly selected training samples before growing the tree.

Higher values tend to cause overfitting. *colsample_bytree* denotes the fraction of columns to be randomly sampled for each tree. *n_estimators* controls the number of trees to be constructed during the classification process.

Notes on imbalanced target features\nIt is very easy to come accross a dataset with imbalanced targets (meaning class 1 is far more represented than class 2). Some of the classifiers like Random Forest, by their design will classify a new item into a class that has more samples in the train set. This behaviour decreases the precision of the classifier.  \n\nDepending on the exact issue there may be different solutions to this problem. It can happen that one is not even interested in a good precision at all. In some cases there can be lot of samples of one class and some in the other class, but in other cases the whole database can be very small. One can choose wether to decrease the number of samples of the large class (undersample) or try to increase the number of the small class (oversample). \n\nThe *imblearn* package provides different methods to perform both cases. The *RandomUnderSampler* reduces the number of the samples in each class to the number of samples in the smallest class. It is done by randomly selecting samples. The *RandomOverSampler* does the some thing but increases the sample of the class where there are only a few samples. These are very simple approaches to balance the sample numbers in classes and they do not really introduce new features.\n\nObviously the best would be to find new samples, but it is not always easy. One could create new samples from existing ones by synthetically contructing them. Such technique is the Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique (SMOTE). It first selects an element in the minority class (the class that needs new samples) and  searches for its n-nearest neighbours. Then these neighbours are connected with the element with a line and random dots are generated on those lines. These will be the synthetically constructed new elements of the class.\n\nLet us use the SMOTE technique and the optimized parameters we learned previously and classify the wines again.","metadata":{"_uuid":"737a2e75aa4a546b4e9829e04457e565f3a85989"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from imblearn.under_sampling import RandomUnderSampler\nfrom imblearn.over_sampling import RandomOverSampler\nfrom collections import Counter\nfrom imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE  \nfrom imblearn.pipeline import Pipeline as imbPipeline","metadata":{"_uuid":"0aa05d52ad13c7ec25ed3a7bb408a61adbe2bc5f","trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"The *imblearn* package is not compatible with the *sklearn* Pipelines, therefore we have to use their ones.

Conclusion\nWe have presented a simple model that is capable of classifying grape varieties based on wine descriptions and their colour. During the process we have cleaned the input data, created objects to turn text documents into numeric matrices while counting the frequency of the words in the text. Then we optimized a hyperparameter in the classifier to achieve better performance. At the end, we highlighted the importance of having balanced number of input classes. \n\nAlthough the achieved accuracy is only 62% for 35 different grapes, this can be improved. The first way of doing that is to getting more data (one of the classes had only 200 samples). Second, one could build up better classifiers either with more thorough hyperparameter tuning or maybe using neural networks. Finally, one can come up with a more sofisticated text vectorizer that relies on maybe information extraction and grammar rules. \n\nFor a more detailed study on a different (smaller) database please visit [my website](https://diveki.github.io/projects/wine/index.html).","metadata":{"_uuid":"a3c488d5251d24aaf9bd79c08a695985b193498c","trusted":true}}]}
